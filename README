1. ncs_navigator_pancakes

This is a Web application for performing queries (and, eventually, data
changes) across many NCS Navigator Cases[1] instances.  In the NUBIC[2]
environment, it's used to aggregate data across an organizationally related
group of Cases instances.  (Pan-Cases: pancakes.)

2. Running it

The short version:

  $ bundle install
  $ vi /etc/nubic/db/local_postgresql.yml  # and verify it's all good
  $ bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate  # db, etc
  $ bundle exec rake                       # tests
