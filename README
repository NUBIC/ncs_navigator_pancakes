1. ncs_navigator_pancakes

This is a Web application for performing queries (and, eventually, data
changes) across many NCS Navigator Cases[1] instances.  In the NUBIC[2]
environment, it's used to aggregate data across an organizationally related
group of Cases instances.  (Pan-Cases: pancakes.)

2. Running tests

The short version:

  $ bundle install
  $ foreman start   # starts up development infrastructure
  $ rake            # runs specs and scenarios
